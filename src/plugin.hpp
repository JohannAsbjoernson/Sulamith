// namespace is a directory of all functions and classes that belong to it. in iomanip its std, for most rack applications rack makes sense.
// functions belonging to a namespace are supposedly easier parsed and during the compiling process the engine knows better how to treat them.
// some will use their own namespace for their module collection when offering a wide range of skins and widget GUI modifications.
// Probably to avoid double-naming (two objects in the same namespace cannot have the same name, less prone to errors)
